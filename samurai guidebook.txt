The Samurai Scrolls

So, you want to be a master in the art of the sword?
This guide book will teach you what is necessary, in
the words of the ancient legend, Rai-Sa-Mu.

1. Basic controls
-Player 1: Arrow keys and P
-Player 2: WASD and Space

2. Wielding the sword
-Don't just flail about! A missed attack leaves you open
for a counterattack.

-Feinting: Double-tap to feint.

3. Movement
-As you move around the stage, you will never take your
eyes off your opponent.

-Pay attention to your surroundings. Your opponent may
be trying to corner you.

-If your opponent strikes, dodge! You will be surprised
at what close encounters you can dodge. Do not try to
counterattack if the opponent is close because you will
be too late.

-Dodge diagonally for best results.

4. Stages
-Dojo: The 'go-to' arena for most samurai.
-Fields: A bit more spacious than the Dojo.
